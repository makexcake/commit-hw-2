# Commit Homework 2
Hello! Welcome to the homework repo.

## Description
The repo consists of the following branches:
* main (this)
* feature/application: Branch with the application and files for codepipeline. On every push the pipeline initiates and deploys the app.
* feature/terraform: terraform branch for setting up the requested infrastructure including the CodePipeline. Feuture plan: devide the template into my own modules.
* feature/cloudformation: Provisions the same infrastructure as the terraform branch (without the CodePipeline). 
Best practice will be is dividing it into separate templates to make nested stacks but I'm late on time.

### Notes tips and tricks will be appriciated.
